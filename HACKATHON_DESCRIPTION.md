# EpiGen: Your AI-Powered Financial Guide

## What We Built

**EpiGen** helps people turn their financial challenges into clear, step-by-step
action plans. Just tell us your problem (like "I want to save money but don't
know where to start"), and our AI creates a personalized visual roadmap that
guides you from problem to solution.

## The Problem We're Solving

Financial advice is often confusing, expensive, or just not personalized. Young
people especially struggle with knowing where to start or how to break down big
goals into manageable steps. We wanted to make financial guidance accessible,
visual, and actually helpful.

## How It Works

1. **Describe your challenge** - Tell us what you're struggling with and what
   you want to achieve
2. **AI creates your roadmap** - Google Gemini AI analyzes your problem and
   generates a step-by-step decision tree (while you wait, check out our fun
   financial literacy mini-game!)
3. **Explore visually** - See your entire journey laid out in an interactive
   tree diagram
4. **Get alternatives** - If a step doesn't work for you, ask for alternative
   solutions and the AI generates new paths

## Key Features

- **AI-Generated Decision Trees**: Turn any problem into a clear visual roadmap
  with 2-6 actionable steps
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Beautiful tree diagrams built with D3.js that
  you can pan, zoom, and explore
- **Alternative Paths**: When one solution doesn't work, get AI-generated
  alternatives instantly
- **Search & Discovery**: Find existing solutions by searching descriptions or
  tags
- **Fullscreen Mode**: Dive deep into complex trees with an immersive fullscreen
  view
- **Bonus: Financial Literacy Mini-Game**: A fun little game to pass the time
  while your tree is generating

## Tech Stack

Built with **Nuxt 4**, **Vue 3**, and **TypeScript** for a modern, type-safe
experience. We use **D3.js** for beautiful tree visualizations, **Google Gemini
AI** for intelligent problem analysis, and **Nuxt UI** for a polished interface.
Everything runs smoothly with client-specific storage so each user's trees stay
private.

## Why It Matters

EpiGen makes financial guidance accessible to everyone. Instead of overwhelming
advice, you get a clear visual path forward. The AI ensures every solution is
personalized to your specific situation, making complex financial decisions feel
manageable and achievable.
